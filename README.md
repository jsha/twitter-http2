This is a Twitter API client for Node that uses HTTP/2.

It uses MIT-licensed code from https://github.com/ciaranj/node-oauth and
https://github.com/reneraab/node-twitter-api, simplifying away parts of
node-oauth not needed for Twitter and parts of node-twitter-api not needed for
my personal projects.

I don't expect to spend much time accepting pull requests or handling issues,
but if you find this module useful and would like to be a co-maintainer, let me
know.
